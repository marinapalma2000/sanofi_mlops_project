## 1. How to Track and Compare Model Training Metrics Across Different Training Runs?

Tracking and comparing model training metrics across different runs can be streamlined using specialized ML experiment tracking tools like MLflow or TensorBoard. These tools allow you to log various metrics such as accuracy, loss, and training duration for each run. By using these tools, you can create a consistent and organized record of all your training experiments, making it easier to visualize and compare the performance of different models or different hyperparameter settings. These comparisons are invaluable for identifying the most effective models and for understanding how changes in your approach affect your modelâ€™s performance.

## 2. How to Perform Versioning of Different Models Trained?

Versioning of trained models is a critical practice in machine learning, ensuring that you can manage and revert to specific model versions as needed. A practical approach to model versioning involves saving each trained model with a unique identifier, which could be based on the training date, version number, or a combination of both. Alongside the model, it's important to store relevant metadata such as training parameters, data used, and performance metrics. This approach not only helps in keeping track of model iterations but also in maintaining a history of how the model has evolved over time, which is essential for both replicability and auditability.

## 3. How to Perform Model Deployment for Real-Time Predictions Serving?

Deploying a model for real-time prediction serving involves setting up a reliable and efficient infrastructure that can process incoming prediction requests and return the model's output swiftly. This usually requires setting up a prediction server or API endpoint that hosts the model. Tools like TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, or custom-built APIs using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI are commonly used for this purpose. The key to successful real-time prediction serving is ensuring that the model is deployed in an environment that can handle the expected request load and that the model inference is optimized for speed without compromising accuracy. Additionally, it's crucial to have monitoring in place to track the performance of the deployed model and to quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.
